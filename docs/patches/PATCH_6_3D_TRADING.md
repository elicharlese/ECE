## Implementation Notes

### Technical Architecture
```typescript
// 3D Trading Environment Structure
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/3d/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ TradingFloor.tsx       # Main 3D environment
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Card3D.tsx             # 3D card component
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Portfolio3D.tsx        # 3D portfolio view
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ MarketVisualization.tsx # 3D market data
â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ use3DRenderer.ts       # 3D rendering logic
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ useWebGLDetection.ts   # Feature detection
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ usePerformanceMonitor.ts # Performance tracking
â””â”€â”€ utils/
    â”œâ”€â”€ 3d-optimization.ts     # Performance utilities
    â””â”€â”€ webgl-fallbacks.ts     # Compatibility helpers
```

### Key Technologies
- **Three.js**: Core 3D rendering engine
- **React Three Fiber**: React integration for Three.js
- **Drei**: Helper components and utilities
- **Leva**: Development GUI for 3D scene debugging

### Performance Targets
- **Desktop**: 60fps at 1080p resolution
- **Mobile**: 30fps with reduced visual effects
- **Memory**: <150MB additional heap usage
- **Load Time**: <3s for initial 3D scene

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- [ ] 3D component rendering tests
- [ ] WebGL detection utility tests
- [ ] Performance monitoring function tests
- [ ] Accessibility helper tests

### Integration Tests
- [ ] 3D/2D mode switching functionality
- [ ] Card interaction in 3D environment
- [ ] Trading operations in 3D mode
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility tests

### Performance Tests
- [ ] Frame rate monitoring across devices
- [ ] Memory leak detection during extended use
- [ ] Load time optimization validation
- [ ] Mobile device performance profiling

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Days 1-2)
1. Three.js integration and basic scene setup
2. WebGL detection and fallback implementation
3. Basic 3D environment structure
4. Performance monitoring baseline

### Phase 2: Core Features (Days 3-5)
1. 3D trading floor environment creation
2. Card 3D model implementation
3. Basic interaction system
4. 2D/3D toggle functionality

### Phase 3: Enhancement (Days 6-7)
1. Advanced animations and effects
2. Performance optimization
3. Accessibility improvements
4. Cross-browser testing and fixes

### Phase 4: Polish (Days 8-10)
1. Visual effects and atmosphere
2. Mobile optimization
3. User experience refinements
4. Documentation and testing completion

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
