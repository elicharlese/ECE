```sql
-- Powerup definitions
powerup_types (id, name, category, rarity, effects, duration)
-- User powerup inventory
user_powerups (id, user_id, powerup_type_id, quantity, acquired_at)
-- Card powerup applications
card_powerups (id, card_id, powerup_id, applied_at, expires_at, active)
-- Powerup effects history
powerup_effects (id, card_id, powerup_id, effect_type, value, timestamp)
```

### API Endpoints
```
GET /api/powerups - List all powerup types
GET /api/powerups/{id} - Get powerup details
POST /api/cards/{id}/powerups - Apply powerup to card
DELETE /api/cards/{id}/powerups/{powerupId} - Remove powerup
GET /api/users/{id}/powerups - Get user powerup inventory
POST /api/powerups/craft - Craft new powerup
```
