# ForSure

A code to efficiently represent file structures for quicker spin and spin down processes. It will make it easier to scale and descale the size of the repo and allow for dynamism in the living codebase. 

This will be written in rust as a live representation of thier use of lifetimes for data storage. The flow will be linear and smooth for best results and variation will be monitored. Containers (AWS) will use this feature to manage thier associations with the elastic storage features of like ELK. 

```bash
aws beanstalk --update && aws beanstalk --health
  
```
