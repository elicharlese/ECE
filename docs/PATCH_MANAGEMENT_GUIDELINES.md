# ECE Patch Management Guidelines
## Version: 1.0
## Date: July 24, 2025

---

## Overview
The ECE project uses a structured patch system to manage feature development, track progress, and maintain clean documentation. This system ensures systematic development while preserving historical context.

## Patch Lifecycle

### 1. Patch Planning (patches/)
- Each patch targets specific features or improvements
- Patches are grouped in sets of 5 for manageable development cycles
- Clear deliverables and acceptance criteria defined upfront

### 2. Development Phase
- Active development in `/patches/` directory
- Real-time documentation updates
- Progress tracking with status indicators

### 3. Archive Process (Every 5 Patches)
- **Trigger:** Completion of patches X-Y (where Y-X = 4)
- **Action:** Move documentation to `/docs/patches/PATCHES_X-Y_ARCHIVE.md`
- **Preserve:** All commit history remains intact
- **Clean:** Remove active patch files from `/patches/`
- **Commit:** Archive commit with clear message

### 4. New Cycle Initialization
- Create new patch documentation for next 5 patches
- Reset `/patches/` directory structure
- Update tracking systems

## Patch Documentation Standards

### Required Sections
1. **Overview** - Brief description and goals
2. **Deliverables** - Specific features to implement
3. **Acceptance Criteria** - Definition of done
4. **Status** - Current progress indicators
5. **Dependencies** - Prerequisites and blockers
6. **Implementation Notes** - Technical details
7. **Testing Requirements** - Validation approach

### Status Indicators
- üöÄ **Planned** - Ready to start
- üîÑ **In Progress** - Active development
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Blocked** - Waiting on dependencies
- ‚úÖ **Complete** - Delivered and tested
- üèÜ **Archived** - Moved to archive

---

## Archive Standards

### Archive Document Format
```markdown
# ECE Patches X-Y Archive
## Date: [Archive Date]
## Status: ARCHIVED - Complete

[Archive content with patches X through Y]

## Archive Process
1. Documentation created: ‚úÖ
2. Code review completed: ‚úÖ
3. Commit history preserved: ‚úÖ
4. Ready for new patch cycle: ‚úÖ
```

### Commit Message Format
```
archive: Complete patches X-Y and prepare for next cycle

- Archive patches X through Y documentation
- Preserve commit history for completed features
- Clean patches directory for new development cycle
- Initialize patches (Y+1) through (Y+5) structure

Archived features:
- [List major features from archived patches]
```
