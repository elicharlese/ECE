# ECE Patch Management Guidelines
## Version: 1.0
## Date: July 24, 2025

---

## Overview
The ECE project uses a structured patch system to manage feature development, track progress, and maintain clean documentation. This system ensures systematic development while preserving historical context.

## Patch Lifecycle

### 1. Patch Planning (patches/)
- Each patch targets specific features or improvements
- Patches are grouped in sets of 5 for manageable development cycles
- Clear deliverables and acceptance criteria defined upfront

### 2. Development Phase
- Active development in `/patches/` directory
- Real-time documentation updates
- Progress tracking with status indicators

### 3. Archive Process (Every 5 Patches)
- **Trigger:** Completion of patches X-Y (where Y-X = 4)
- **Action:** Consolidate to `/docs/patches/PATCHES_X-Y_ARCHIVE.md`
- **Preserve:** All commit history remains intact via git references
- **Clean:** Remove root `./patches/` directory and legacy patch folders
- **Structure:** Maintain only active documentation in `/docs/patches/`
- **Commit:** Archive commit with comprehensive change description

### 4. New Cycle Initialization
- Create new patch documentation for next 5 patches
- Reset `/patches/` directory structure
- Update tracking systems

## Directory Structure

```
/docs/patches/           # All patch documentation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PATCHES_1-5_ARCHIVE.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PATCHES_6-10_MASTER.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PATCH_6_3D_TRADING.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PATCH_7_ENTERPRISE.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PATCH_8_CLI_TOOLS.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PATCH_9_SOCIAL.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ PATCH_10_AI_ANALYTICS.md

# No more root ./patches/ directory
# All development documented in /docs/patches/
```

## Patch Documentation Standards

### Required Sections
1. **Overview** - Brief description and goals
2. **Deliverables** - Specific features to implement
3. **Acceptance Criteria** - Definition of done
4. **Status** - Current progress indicators
5. **Dependencies** - Prerequisites and blockers
6. **Implementation Notes** - Technical details
7. **Testing Requirements** - Validation approach

### Status Indicators
- üöÄ **Planned** - Ready to start
- üîÑ **In Progress** - Active development
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Blocked** - Waiting on dependencies
- ‚úÖ **Complete** - Delivered and tested
- üèÜ **Archived** - Moved to archive

---

## Archive Standards

### Archive Document Format
```markdown
# ECE Patches X-Y Archive
## Date: [Archive Date]
## Status: ARCHIVED - Complete

[Archive content with patches X through Y]

## Archive Process
1. Documentation created: ‚úÖ
2. Code review completed: ‚úÖ
3. Commit history preserved: ‚úÖ
4. Ready for new patch cycle: ‚úÖ
```

### Commit Message Format
```
üóÇÔ∏è Archive patches X-Y and clean repository structure

- Remove root ./patches directory (development workspace cleanup)
- Clean up /docs/patches to contain only active documentation  
- Maintain PATCHES_X-Y_ARCHIVE.md with complete history
- Establish clean structure for patches (Y+1)-(Y+5) development phase
- Ready for next patch cycle with organized documentation

Archived features: [List major features]

## Quality Gates

### Before Archive
- [ ] All patch deliverables completed
- [ ] Code review passed
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated

- [ ] Verify commit history preservation with git references
- [ ] Remove root ./patches directory if present
- [ ] Clean /docs/patches of legacy patch folders
- [ ] Maintain only active patch documentation 
- [ ] Initialize next patch cycle documentation
- [ ] Update project status and roadmap
- [ ] Commit archive changes with descriptive message

   - Systematic feature delivery
   - Stakeholder communication aid

4. **Maintenance Efficiency**
   - Organized documentation structure
   - Predictable archive schedule
   - Simplified project navigation
