# NEAR Rust SDK Smart Contract Requirements

## 1. Rust Environment
Ensure that you have the Rust environment set up. You need to have Rustup, Rust (stable version), and wasm32-unknown-unknown target installed.

## 2. NEAR Rust SDK
The NEAR Rust SDK should be included as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml` file.

## 3. Contract Structure
Your contract should be a Rust module with a public struct that implements the methods you want to expose.

## 4. Entry Points
Each method in your contract that you want to call as a function should be exposed as an entry point.

## 5. Serialization
NEAR uses JSON for serialization and deserialization. You need to use the `serde` and `serde_json` crates for this.

## 6. Testing
NEAR provides a simulation testing framework that allows you to write tests for your contract in Rust and run them in a simulated blockchain runtime.

## 7. Deployment
Your contract should be compiled to WebAssembly (WASM) using the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target. The resulting WASM file can be deployed to the NEAR blockchain.

## 8. Cross Contract Calls
NEAR supports cross contract calls. You can use the `promise` API provided by the NEAR Rust SDK to make asynchronous calls to other contracts.

## 9. Storage
NEAR provides a key-value storage API that you can use to store and retrieve data in your contract.

## 10. Gas Management
You need to be aware of the gas costs of your contract operations and manage them appropriately to avoid running out of gas.

## 11. Error Handling
You should handle errors appropriately in your contract. NEAR provides the `env::panic` and `env::log` methods for error handling and logging.

## 12. Access Control
You can use the `env::predecessor_account_id` and `env::signer_account_id` methods to implement access control in your contract.
