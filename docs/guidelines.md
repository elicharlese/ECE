## Documentation Structure

### Root Documentation Directory: `/docs`
The `/docs` folder contains all project documentation organized by purpose and development phase.

## Patch Documentation Standards

### Patch Naming Convention
- Patches are numbered sequentially starting from `patch-0`
- Each patch represents a major development phase or milestone
- Patch folders follow the pattern: `/docs/patches/patch-n/`

### Required Files per Patch
Each patch folder must contain:

1. **`PATCHn_CHECKLIST.md`**
   - Comprehensive checklist of all tasks for the patch
   - Organized by categories (e.g., Implementation, Testing, Documentation)
   - Uses checkbox format `- [ ]` for trackable progress
   - Includes completion dates and responsible parties

2. **`PATCHn_SUMMARY.md`**
   - High-level overview of the patch objectives
   - Key deliverables and success criteria
   - Dependencies and prerequisites
   - Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
   - Post-completion retrospective and lessons learned

### Patch Themes
- **Patch-0**: Backend Infrastructure (Database, API, Authentication)
- **Patch-1**: Frontend UI/UX Development
- **Patch-2**: App Routing & Admin Security Optimization
- **Patch-3**: 3D Integration & Documentation Standardization
- **Patch-4**: Performance & Advanced Features
- **Patch-5**: Security & Compliance Enhancement

## Batch Documentation Standards

### Batch Naming Convention
- Batches are numbered sequentially starting from `batch-0`
- Each batch represents a collection of related features or improvements
- Batch folders follow the pattern: `/docs/batches/batch-n/`

### Required Files per Batch
Each batch folder must contain:

1. **`BATCHn_CHECKLIST.md`**
   - Feature-specific implementation checklist
   - User story acceptance criteria
   - Integration requirements
   - Testing verification steps

2. **`BATCHn_SUMMARY.md`**
   - Feature overview and business value
   - Technical implementation approach
   - User impact assessment
   - Performance metrics and KPIs

## Documentation Standards

### File Naming Conventions
- Use UPPERCASE for major documentation files (CHECKLIST, SUMMARY, README)
- Use kebab-case for descriptive filenames (api-reference.md, deployment-guide.md)
- Include version numbers where applicable (v1.0-migration-guide.md)

### Content Structure
All documentation should include:

1. **Clear Title and Overview**
2. **Table of Contents** (for longer documents)
3. **Prerequisites and Dependencies**
4. **Step-by-Step Instructions**
5. **Examples and Code Samples**
6. **Troubleshooting Section**
7. **Related Resources and Links**

### Markdown Standards
- Use proper heading hierarchy (H1 for title, H2 for main sections, etc.)
- Include code blocks with language specification
- Use tables for structured data
- Add emoji icons for visual organization (ðŸ“‹ for checklists, ðŸš€ for deployment, etc.)
- Include completion checkboxes for actionable items

### Version Control
- All documentation changes should be committed with descriptive messages
- Major documentation updates should be tagged with version numbers
- Archive outdated documentation rather than deleting it

## Content Organization

### Core Documentation (`/docs/core/`)
- Project vision and objectives
- High-level architecture decisions
- Technology stack rationale
- Project completion summaries

### API Documentation (`/docs/api/`)
- OpenAPI/Swagger specifications
- Endpoint documentation
- Authentication guides
- Rate limiting and usage policies

### Architecture Documentation (`/docs/architecture/`)
- System design diagrams
- Database schemas
- Service architecture
- Integration patterns

### Deployment Documentation (`/docs/deployment/`)
- Environment setup guides
- CI/CD pipeline documentation
- Production deployment checklists
- Monitoring and maintenance procedures

### Development Documentation (`/docs/development/`)
- Development environment setup
- Coding standards and best practices
- Testing procedures
- Development workflow guides

### User Guides (`/docs/user-guides/`)
- End-user documentation
- Feature tutorials
- FAQ and troubleshooting
- Getting started guides

## Review and Maintenance

### Documentation Review Process
1. All documentation changes require peer review
2. Technical accuracy must be verified by domain experts
3. User experience should be tested with actual users
4. Documentation should be updated with each feature release

### Maintenance Schedule
- **Weekly**: Update development notes and progress tracking
- **Sprint End**: Complete patch/batch summaries and retrospectives
- **Release**: Update user guides and API documentation
- **Quarterly**: Review and archive outdated documentation

## Quality Standards

### Accuracy Requirements
- All code examples must be tested and functional
- Screenshots and diagrams must be current
- Links and references must be valid
- Version numbers must be accurate

### Accessibility Standards
- Use clear, concise language
- Provide alternative text for images
- Structure content with proper headings
- Include search-friendly keywords

### Internationalization
- Use inclusive language
- Avoid cultural references that may not translate
- Consider future localization needs
- Use standard date and time formats

## Tools and Resources

### Recommended Tools
- **Markdown Editor**: VSCode with Markdown extensions
- **Diagram Creation**: Mermaid, Draw.io, or Lucidchart
- **Screenshot Tools**: Built-in OS tools or Snagit
- **Link Checking**: markdown-link-check or similar tools

### Templates
Standard templates are available for:
- Patch checklists and summaries
