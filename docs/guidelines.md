# ECE Trading Cards Documentation Guidelines

## Overview
This document outlines the documentation structure and guidelines for the ECE Trading Cards application. All project documentation should follow these standards to maintain consistency and organization.

## Documentation Structure

### Root Documentation Directory: `/docs`
The `/docs` folder contains all project documentation organized by purpose and development phase.

## Patch Documentation Standards

### Archive System
The ECE project uses a structured 5-patch archive cycle:
- **Active Patches**: Individual patch documentation and working directories
- **Archive Process**: Every 5 patches are consolidated into a master archive
- **Historical Preservation**: Complete git history maintained via archive documentation
- **Clean Structure**: Repository organized with current active patches only

### Patch Naming Convention
- **Archive Files**: `PATCHES_X-Y_ARCHIVE.md` (e.g., `PATCHES_1-5_ARCHIVE.md`)
- **Master Plans**: `PATCHES_X-Y_MASTER.md` (e.g., `PATCHES_6-10_MASTER.md`)
- **Individual Docs**: `PATCH_X_FEATURE_NAME.md` (e.g., `PATCH_6_3D_TRADING.md`)
- **Working Folders**: `patch-X/` (lowercase with hyphen, e.g., `patch-6/`)

### Required Files per Patch Folder
Each patch working directory must contain:

1. **`PATCHX_CHECKLIST.md`**
   - Comprehensive implementation checklist with progress tracking
   - Organized by development phases (Setup, Implementation, Testing, etc.)
   - Uses checkbox format `- [ ]` for trackable progress
   - Includes estimated completion times and team assignments

2. **`PATCHX_PROGRESS.md`**
   - Real-time progress tracking and status updates
   - Sprint planning and timeline management
   - Blocker identification and risk assessment
   - Development notes and lessons learned

3. **`working/`** - Active development files and code
4. **`prototypes/`** - Experimental implementations and proof-of-concepts  
5. **`assets/`** - Patch-specific resources, designs, and documentation

### Current Patch Cycle (6-10)
- **Patch 6**: 3D Trading Environment Enhancement (10 days)
- **Patch 7**: Enterprise Integration Suite (15 days)
- **Patch 8**: CLI Development Tools & Automation (15 days)
- **Patch 9**: Social Features & Community Platform (20 days)
- **Patch 10**: Advanced Trading Analytics & AI (25 days)

## Batch Documentation Standards

### Batch Naming Convention
- Batches are numbered sequentially starting from `batch-0`
- Each batch represents a collection of related features or improvements
- Batch folders follow the pattern: `/docs/batches/batch-n/`

### Required Files per Batch
Each batch folder must contain:

1. **`BATCHn_CHECKLIST.md`**
   - Feature-specific implementation checklist
   - User story acceptance criteria
   - Integration requirements
   - Testing verification steps

2. **`BATCHn_SUMMARY.md`**
   - Feature overview and business value
   - Technical implementation approach
   - User impact assessment
   - Performance metrics and KPIs

## Documentation Standards

### File Naming Conventions
- Use UPPERCASE for major documentation files (CHECKLIST, PROGRESS, ARCHIVE)
- Use descriptive feature names in patch documentation (3D_TRADING, ENTERPRISE, AI_ANALYTICS)
- Working folders use lowercase with hyphens (patch-6/, working/, prototypes/)
- Follow naming strategy defined in `/docs/naming-strategy.md`

### Archive Documentation Standards
Every 5 patches are consolidated into comprehensive archive files:

1. **`PATCHES_X-Y_ARCHIVE.md`**
   - Complete summary of all 5 patches in the cycle
   - Individual patch summaries with key achievements
   - Implementation statistics and metrics
   - Lessons learned and best practices
   - Git commit references for historical tracking
   - Post-cycle retrospective and recommendations

2. **Archive Process**
   - Triggered upon completion of 5 consecutive patches
   - Individual patch folders and files are consolidated
   - Complete git history preserved via commit references
   - Repository structure cleaned for next development cycle
   - Archive tagged in git for permanent reference

### Content Structure
All documentation should include:

1. **Clear Title and Overview**
2. **Table of Contents** (for longer documents)
3. **Prerequisites and Dependencies**
4. **Step-by-Step Instructions**
5. **Examples and Code Samples**
6. **Troubleshooting Section**
7. **Related Resources and Links**

### Markdown Standards
- Use proper heading hierarchy (H1 for title, H2 for main sections, etc.)
- Include code blocks with language specification
- Use tables for structured data
- Add emoji icons for visual organization (📋 for checklists, 🚀 for deployment, etc.)
- Include completion checkboxes for actionable items

### Version Control
- All documentation changes should be committed with descriptive messages following `/docs/naming-strategy.md`
- Patch completion marked with standardized commit messages: `✅ PATCH X: Feature Name - COMPLETE`
- Archive commits use format: `🗂️ Archive patches X-Y and clean repository structure`
- Major documentation updates should be tagged with version numbers
- Archive outdated documentation rather than deleting it (preserve in archive files)

## Content Organization

### Core Documentation (`/docs/core/`)
- Project vision and objectives
- High-level architecture decisions
- Technology stack rationale
- Project completion summaries

### API Documentation (`/docs/api/`)
- OpenAPI/Swagger specifications
- Endpoint documentation
- Authentication guides
- Rate limiting and usage policies

### Architecture Documentation (`/docs/architecture/`)
- System design diagrams
- Database schemas
- Service architecture
- Integration patterns

### Deployment Documentation (`/docs/deployment/`)
- Environment setup guides
- CI/CD pipeline documentation
- Production deployment checklists
- Monitoring and maintenance procedures

### Development Documentation (`/docs/development/`)
- Development environment setup
- Coding standards and best practices
- Testing procedures
- Development workflow guides

### User Guides (`/docs/user-guides/`)
- End-user documentation
- Feature tutorials
- FAQ and troubleshooting
- Getting started guides

## Review and Maintenance

### Documentation Review Process
1. All documentation changes require peer review
2. Technical accuracy must be verified by domain experts
3. User experience should be tested with actual users
4. Documentation should be updated with each feature release

### Maintenance Schedule
- **Daily**: Update patch progress tracking during active development
- **Weekly**: Review patch checklists and update progress status
- **Sprint End**: Complete patch summaries and retrospectives
- **Patch Completion**: Archive completed patches and update master documentation
- **Cycle End (Every 5 Patches)**: Create comprehensive archive and clean repository structure

## Quality Standards

### Accuracy Requirements
- All code examples must be tested and functional
- Screenshots and diagrams must be current
- Links and references must be valid
- Version numbers must be accurate

### Accessibility Standards
- Use clear, concise language
- Provide alternative text for images
- Structure content with proper headings
- Include search-friendly keywords

### Internationalization
- Use inclusive language
- Avoid cultural references that may not translate
- Consider future localization needs
- Use standard date and time formats

## Tools and Resources

### Recommended Tools
- **Markdown Editor**: VSCode with Markdown extensions
- **Diagram Creation**: Mermaid, Draw.io, or Lucidchart
- **Screenshot Tools**: Built-in OS tools or Snagit
- **Link Checking**: markdown-link-check or similar tools

### Templates
Standard templates are available for:
- Patch checklists and progress tracking (`PATCHX_CHECKLIST.md`, `PATCHX_PROGRESS.md`)
- Archive documentation (`PATCHES_X-Y_ARCHIVE.md`)
- Individual patch documentation (`PATCH_X_FEATURE_NAME.md`)
- API endpoint documentation
- Feature specifications
- Deployment guides

### Patch Management Integration
- Follow `/docs/PATCH_MANAGEMENT_GUIDELINES.md` for complete patch lifecycle
- Use `/docs/naming-strategy.md` for consistent naming across all files
- Reference archive system for historical patch documentation
- Maintain clean repository structure through regular archival process
