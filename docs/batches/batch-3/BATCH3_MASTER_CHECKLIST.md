## Success Criteria

All items in this checklist have been completed, marking the successful implementation of NFT functionality in the ECE platform.

## Completion Notes

The NFT integration has been successfully implemented and tested. All core functionality is working as expected:

1. App cards can be minted as unique NFTs on the Solana blockchain
2. On-chain ownership is properly tracked and synchronized
3. Rich metadata is generated and stored on decentralized storage
4. Real wallet integration is working with Solana Wallet Adapter
5. All API endpoints are functional and properly secured
6. Comprehensive documentation has been created

The implementation fulfills the original requirements to make app cards NFTs with unique, secure ownership and enable synthetic value/pricing for apps similar to an ICO.
