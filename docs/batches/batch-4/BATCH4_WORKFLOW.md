   - Mitigation: Implement proper indexing and caching

2. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connections may fail
   - Mitigation: Implement fallback mechanisms and error handling

3. **Complex Business Logic**: Auction and bidding logic may have edge cases
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive testing and code review

4. **Integration Challenges**: Connecting frontend to backend APIs
   - Mitigation: Well-defined API contracts and mock data

### Contingency Plans
1. If performance issues arise, implement additional caching
2. If real-time features are unstable, provide polling alternatives
3. If business logic is too complex, simplify requirements
4. If integration takes longer than expected, extend timeline
