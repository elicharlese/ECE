Sure, I can provide the markdown files for both the developer and user documentation. Below are the contents of two files which you can place in a 
 folder.

# Developer Documentation
## Overview
The platform integrates multiple applications (`Bitcell`, `ThePublic`, `SocketChat`, `NanoNode`, and `TxnTracker`) into a cohesive dashboard within the `ECE.tsx` component. It uses `react-router-dom` for routing and Redux for state management.

## Setting Up the Development Environment
### Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
Run the Development Server
npm start
File Descriptions
: Main component housing all the applications with routing.
: Navigation bar for the platform.
Redux Store: Manages global state.
Individual App Components (under _pages folder):
Adding a New Application
Create a new folder under _pages for your app.
Implement your React component in the new folder.
Import and add a new route for your component in 
.
Add a navigation link in 
.
Example: Adding a New App
Create 
 under _pages/NewApp/.
// apps/ece/src/app/frontend/content/ECE/_pages/NewApp/NewApp.tsx
import React from 'react';
const NewApp = () => {
  return <div>New App Content</div>;
};
export default NewApp;
Add a route in 
.
import NewApp from './_pages/NewApp/NewApp';
...
<Route path="/new-app" component={NewApp} />
...
Add a link in 
.
<li><Link to="/new-app">New App</Link></li>
Common Issues and Troubleshooting
Navigation Not Working
Ensure the URLs in the address bar match the routes defined in 
.
State Not Updating
Verify Redux store configuration and action dispatches.
API Calls Failing
Check network requests in the Developer Tools and ensure the backend services are running.
### User Documentation (`./docs/User_Documentation.md`)
