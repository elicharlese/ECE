# Certainly

## Below is a simplified example of a versioning timeline using git tags and commits for hypothetical sprints planned in a project. This assumes using Semantic Versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) where

- MAJOR version increment indicates incompatible API changes,
- MINOR version increment indicates new functionality in a backward-compatible manner,
- PATCH version increment indicates backward-compatible bug fixes.

### Sprint 1: Initial Development

- **Commit**: Initialize project structure.
- **Tag**: None yet (development phase).

### Sprint 2: Add Login Feature

- **Commit**: Implement basic login functionality.
- **Commit**: Write tests for login feature.
- **Commit**: Fix bug discovered in login form validation.
- **Tag**: `v0.1.0` (First minor release, adding a new feature - the login capability).

### Sprint 3: Add User Profiles

- **Commit**: Create user profile model.
- **Commit**: Add profile view.
- **Commit**: Implement profile editing.
- **Tag**: `v0.2.0` (Second minor release, adding new feature - user profiles).

### Sprint 4: Bug Fixes and Documentation

- **Commit**: Fix profile image upload bug.
- **Commit**: Update documentation for profile feature.
- **Tag**: `v0.2.1` (Patch release, fixing bugs related to user profiles).

### Sprint 5: Add Messaging Feature

- **Commit**: Implement direct messaging between users.
- **Commit**: Add message notifications.
- **Commit**: Optimize database queries for messaging.
- **Tag**: `v0.3.0` (Third minor release, adding new feature - messaging).

### Sprint 6: Prepare for 1.0 Release

- **Commit**: Refactor login to use two-factor authentication.
- **Commit**: Revise and clean up codebase.
- **Commit**: Finalize all feature documentation.
- **Tag**: `v1.0.0-rc` (Release candidate for the major version).

### Sprint 7: Release 1.0 and Hotfixes

- **Commit**: Launch Version 1.0.
- **Tag**: `v1.0.0` (Official major release).
- **Commit**: Hotfix for critical login bug.
- **Tag**: `v1.0.1` (Patch release - urgent bug fix post-launch).

### Sprint 8: Additional Features

... Development continues ...

### Git Commands for Tagging

To create tags at the end of each sprint, you would use the git tag command. For example, after completing sprint 2, you might do the following:

```sh
git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Sprint 2: Add Login Feature"
git push origin v0.1.0
```

The `-a` flag creates an annotated tag that includes metadata such as the tagger's name, email, and date. The `-m` flag allows you to add a tagging message.

For sprint 7's hotfix tag, if it was the last commit made, you can simply do:

```sh
git tag -a v1.0.1 -m "Hotfix for critical login bug"
git push origin v1.0.1
```

Remember to replace `origin` with the name of the remote to which you're pushing tags if it's different in your case.

Additionally, consider including a `CHANGELOG.md` in your project to document these changes in a human-readable format. It's also a good practice to use branches for development and only merge into `main` or `master` when the feature is ready for a release.
