# ECE Platform - Data Flow Architecture

## Overview

This document details the data flow architecture for the ECE (Elite Card Exchange) platform, covering how data moves through the system from user interactions to database storage, blockchain operations, and real-time updates. The architecture is designed to ensure efficient, secure, and consistent data handling across all platform components.

## Data Flow Principles

### 1. Consistency
- **ACID Compliance**: Database transactions maintain atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability
- **Eventual Consistency**: Distributed systems maintain eventual consistency where appropriate
- **Data Synchronization**: Regular synchronization between database and blockchain states

### 2. Security
- **Encryption**: Data encryption at rest and in transit
- **Access Control**: Role-based and attribute-based access control for all data flows
- **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive logging of all data access and modifications

### 3. Performance
- **Caching**: Multi-layer caching to reduce database load
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Non-blocking operations for improved responsiveness
- **Load Distribution**: Even distribution of data processing across services

### 4. Reliability
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry of failed operations with exponential backoff
- **Data Backup**: Regular backups and disaster recovery procedures

## Core Data Flow Patterns

### User Authentication Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User] --> B[Auth Service]
