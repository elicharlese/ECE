# Order Flow Architecture for Card Creation and Enhancement

## Overview

The Order Flow system enables users to create new digital asset cards (representing apps or companies) and enhance existing cards through a comprehensive ordering and fulfillment process. The system integrates with the broader ECE platform to provide seamless card generation, enhancement, and marketplace integration.

## Core Features

### Card Creation Orders
- **App Generation**: Custom application development based on user specifications
- **Company Card Creation**: Digital representation of real-world companies
- **Template-based Creation**: Pre-built templates for common app types
- **Custom Specifications**: Detailed requirement gathering and validation

### Card Enhancement Orders
- **Powerup Integration**: Adding enhancement effects to existing cards
- **Stat Improvements**: Upgrading card performance metrics
- **Visual Enhancements**: 3D model and animation improvements
- **Rarity Upgrades**: Progression through rarity tiers

## System Architecture

### Order Types

#### Primary Order Types
- `CARD_CREATION`: New card/app development from scratch
- `CARD_ENHANCEMENT`: Enhancement of existing user-owned cards
- `CARD_UPGRADE`: Rarity tier progression and major improvements
- `BULK_ORDER`: Multiple cards or batch processing

#### Order Priorities
- `STANDARD`: Normal processing (1-2 weeks)
- `HIGH`: Expedited processing (3-5 days)
- `URGENT`: Rush orders (1-2 days)

### Database Schema

#### Core Order Tables
- `AppOrder`: Main order record with user, type, and status
- `OrderRevision`: Revision requests and admin responses
- `OrderCommunication`: Messaging between users and admins
- `OrderDeliverable`: Individual deliverables within orders

#### Integration Tables
- `Card`: Links orders to created/enhanced cards
- `PowerupType`: Available enhancements for orders
- `User`: Order creator and balance management

### Order Processing Pipeline

#### Phase 1: Order Submission
1. User selects order type and provides specifications
2. System validates requirements and user balance
3. Order created with PENDING status
4. Initial communication record created
5. User balance escrowed for order cost

#### Phase 2: Review and Approval
1. Admin reviews order requirements
2. Clarification requests via communication system
3. Order approved or revision requested
4. Timeline and deliverables established
5. Order status updated to APPROVED

#### Phase 3: Development/Enhancement
1. Development team assigned to order
2. Progress tracked through deliverable system
3. Regular updates via communication system
4. Quality checks at milestones
5. Revision handling for user feedback

#### Phase 4: Delivery and Completion
1. Final deliverables prepared
2. Card created/enhanced in database
3. User notified of completion
4. Balance released from escrow
5. Post-delivery support period

## API Architecture

### REST Endpoints

#### Order Management
- `GET /api/orders`: List user's orders with filtering
- `POST /api/orders`: Create new order
- `PUT /api/orders/[id]`: Update order (cancel, request revision)
- `GET /api/orders/[id]`: Get detailed order information

#### Communication System
- `GET /api/orders/[id]/communications`: Get order messages
- `POST /api/orders/[id]/communications`: Send message
- `PUT /api/orders/[id]/communications/[msgId]`: Mark as read

#### Revision System
- `POST /api/orders/[id]/revisions`: Request revision
- `GET /api/orders/[id]/revisions`: List revisions
- `PUT /api/orders/[id]/revisions/[revId]`: Update revision status

### Real-time Features
- WebSocket connections for live order updates
- Push notifications for status changes
- Real-time chat for order communications
- Live progress tracking

## Frontend Components

### Order Creation Flow
- `OrderWizard`: Multi-step order creation process
- `RequirementForm`: Detailed specification collection
- `CostCalculator`: Dynamic pricing based on selections
- `TimelineSelector`: Delivery timeline options

### Order Management
- `OrderDashboard`: Overview of all user orders
- `OrderDetailView`: Comprehensive order information
- `CommunicationPanel`: Messaging interface
- `ProgressTracker`: Visual progress indicators

### Enhancement System
- `EnhancementSelector`: Available powerups and upgrades
- `CardPreview`: Before/after enhancement visualization
- `CostBreakdown`: Detailed pricing for enhancements
- `CompatibilityChecker`: Enhancement compatibility validation

## Data Flow

### New Card Creation Flow
1. User initiates order creation
2. System presents order type selection
3. User provides detailed specifications
4. System calculates cost and timeline
5. Order submitted and balance escrowed
6. Admin review and approval process
7. Development team creates card
8. Quality assurance and testing
9. Card delivered to user inventory
10. Balance released and order completed

### Card Enhancement Flow
1. User selects card for enhancement
2. System shows available enhancement options
3. User selects desired enhancements
4. Cost calculation and balance verification
5. Order created and balance escrowed
6. Enhancement applied to card
7. Quality verification
8. Enhanced card returned to inventory
9. Order completion and balance release

## Cost Calculation System

### Base Pricing Structure
```typescript
const BASE_PRICES = {
  CARD_CREATION: {
    STANDARD: 4000,  // 1 month
    RUSH: 8000       // 2 weeks
  },
  CARD_ENHANCEMENT: {
    STANDARD: 500,   // Basic enhancement
    ADVANCED: 1500,  // Major enhancement
    PREMIUM: 3000    // Full upgrade
  }
}
```

### Dynamic Pricing Factors
- **Complexity Multiplier**: Based on project requirements
- **Timeline Multiplier**: Rush orders cost more
- **Priority Multiplier**: Urgent orders have premium pricing
- **Bulk Discount**: Reduced pricing for multiple orders

### Cost Breakdown Display
- Base cost for selected service
- Complexity and timeline multipliers
- Enhancement-specific costs
- Total with ECE balance verification
- Payment processing fees (if applicable)
