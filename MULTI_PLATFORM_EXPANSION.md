## 🎯 Multi-Platform Expansion Plan

### **Technology Stack Decision**
- **Monorepo**: Nx Workspace for unified development
- **Desktop**: Electron + React (native features, offline mode)
- **Mobile**: React Native (iOS/Android shared codebase)
- **Web**: Next.js (existing platform enhanced)
- **Shared**: TypeScript libraries (70-80% code reuse)

### **Architecture Benefits**
- 🔄 **Unified Codebase**: Share business logic, UI components, utilities
- 🎨 **Consistent Design**: Unified design system across platforms
- 📱 **Native Features**: Platform-specific optimizations
- 🔄 **Synchronized Updates**: Deploy to all platforms simultaneously
- ⚡ **Development Efficiency**: Single team, multiple platforms
