The Chainlink protocol is a decentralized network of nodes that provides real-world data to smart contracts on the blockchain. It's designed to allow blockchain smart contracts to interact securely with external data sources, APIs, and payment systems, which expands their capabilities by enabling them to use inputs and outputs that are not natively possible within their platform.

Key Components
1. Oracle Nodes
These are independent node operators who fetch data from external sources and bring it onto the blockchain. They serve as a bridge between blockchains and the outside world.

2. Smart Contracts
Aggregating Contract: Collects data from multiple Oracles to ensure data quality and redundancy.
Order-Matching Contract: Takes a service level agreement (SLA) from a user and matches it with Oracle providers.
Reputation Contract: Checks an Oracle provider's track record for performance and honesty.
3. Chainlink Token (LINK)
The LINK token is used to pay for services on the C
